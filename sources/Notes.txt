Current Work in Progress (New from version 3.000):
- Language Extension to AfricanPri (similar charset to latest Baskerville)
- 271 new glyphs in 4 masters (Thin & Black masters - regular and italic).
- All the African related, plus some more latin diacritics.

Extra idea, optional:
Add a intermedie medium master for better interpolation control and finesse.
Both in regular & italic

Cheers,
Pablo
